## 5. Technical Architecture

*   **Stack:** Static HTML5.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS v4 (compiled via CLI).
*   **Icons:** Lucide Icons (via CDN).
*   **Structure:**
    *   `index.html`: Hero, Hook, Partners.
    *   `dna.html`: History, Leadership, Hall of Fame.
    *   `impact.html`: The 3 Pillars (Sport, Education, Nutrition).
    *   `support.html`: Donation Tiers, Campaigns, International Giving.
    *   `contact.html`: Physical address, form, specific email contacts.

### ⚠️ Build Process (IMPORTANT)
After making any changes to HTML files that add or modify Tailwind CSS classes, you **MUST** rebuild the CSS:

```bash
npm run build
```

This compiles `src/input.css` → `css/styles.css`. Without this step, new Tailwind classes will not be applied and the page will appear broken.

**Files:**
*   Source: `src/input.css`
*   Output: `css/styles.css` (do not edit directly)

## 6. Content Strategy Guidelines

*   **The "Life Cycling" Pillars:** Always categorize impact into:
    1.  **Sport (The Carrot):** Medals, podiums, discipline.
    2.  **Education (The Purpose):** ICT lab, tutoring, matric results.
    3.  **Nutrition (The Fuel):** Daily meals, health.
*   **The "Container" Narrative:** Frame the shipping containers not as poverty, but as the "incubator" of talent.
*   **Call to Action (CTA):** Use active, sports-related verbs: "Join the Peloton", "Fuel the Future", "Ride with Us".
